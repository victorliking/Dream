/*
'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

The function prototype should be:
bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)

Some examples:
isMatch("aa","a") → false
isMatch("aa","aa") → true
isMatch("aaa","aa") → false
isMatch("aa", "*") → true
isMatch("aa", "a*") → true
isMatch("ab", "?*") → true
isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") → false
*/

/*
Let's briefly summarize the idea of DP. We define the state P[i][j] to be whether s[0..i) matches p[0..j). The state equations are as follows:

P[i][j] = P[i - 1][j - 1] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 1] || p[j - 1] == '?'), if p[j - 1] != '*';
P[i][j] = P[i][j - 1] || P[i - 1][j], if p[j - 1] == '*'.

*/

/*
For each element in s
If *s==*p or *p == ? which means this is a match, then goes to next element s++ p++.
If p=='*', this is also a match, but one or many chars may be available, so let us save this *'s position and the matched s position.
If not match, then we check if there is a * previously showed up,
       if there is no *,  return false;
       if there is an *,  we set current p to the next element of *, and set current s to the next saved s position.
